<hr/>
<ul>
<li>Created UI Based library system in python to digitalize and keep all book transactions , entry-departure log to be stored in 
databases instead of maintaining a physical log such as log notebook and also to store student details in Databases. </li>
<li>Have experience in storing ,retrieving ,manipulating and processing data in SQL databases, CSV files </li>
<li>Have trained algorithms such as haarcascade, LBPH, BFMatcher with images data to recognize faces and 
objects(books in this system) </li>
</ul>

<h4>PROJECTS </h4>
<p><b><u>Face recognition and object feature detection based system </u></b></p>
<p><b>Description :</b> Uploaded the images of library books , trained the model with these images with their labels with BFMatcher to recognize 
the books to enter the transaction (receiving and submitting) of the books. Uploaded the images of students along with their details 
and trained the algorithm to recognize the students to enter their entry and departure along with timestamp in the library and also to 
enter the book transaction done by them. </p>
<p><b>Tools Used :</b> Python , TKInter , Sqlite3 , CSV , Haarcascade , LBPH , BFMatcher | Key Skill : Creating UI based attendance system, RDBMS.</p>
